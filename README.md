Database:
------------

The database is MongoDB. It has three collections: users, shelf and requests.

The users collection has all the users. Each user document is constructed as follows:

`
{

    "name": name,
    "email": email,
    "password": hashed password,
    "address": address,
    "city": city,
    "state": state,
    "zip": zip code,
    "booksAdded": number,
    "books": [// isbns],
    "incomingRequests": [// incoming requests IDs],
    "outgoingRequests": [// outgoing requests IDs]
}`

The email address is unique for each user and used to look up the user.
Note that books array is an array of isbn codes.
Both requests arrays are lists of requestIDs only.

The shelf collection has a list of all the books added by all users, each book document looks as follows:
`
{

    "owners": [// A list of emails of all the users],
    "title": title,
    "link": more information link,
    "image": book cover link,
    "authors": author,
    "categories": categories,
    "pages": number of pages,
    "description": description,
    "isbn": isbn code
}`

Each book is identified by its isbn which is unique.
To avoid duplication in All Books page, if a user adds/removes a books which is already owned by another user, the email of the new user is added to or removed from the book's document instead of creating or removing a whole document.

The requests collection has all the requests, each request documents looks as follows:
`
{

    "requestID": requestID,
    "requestedBook": {
        "isbn": idbn,
        "title": title
    },
    "tradedBook": {
        "isbn": isbn,
        "title": title
    },
    "requestedBy": {
        "name": name,
        "email": email
    },
    "requestedFrom": {
        "name": name,
        "email": email
    },
    "status": status
}`

The requestID is created by combining the isbn codes of the two books included in the trade.
